# PyBer_Analysis

## *The Goal and Methodology*
### In this analysis we had two goals. Our first goal was to summarize the PyBer ride data by ride types and provide a graph showcasing the weekly data trend for the first 4 months of 2019.

## *A Data Summary by City Type*
#### In our summary we needed 5 metrics each broken out by type of city:

1. Total Rides
2. Total Drivers
3. Total Fares
4. Average Fare per Ride
5. Average Fare per Driver

The table we used to summarize these data points by city type is shown below. We learned several key points between each city type.

1. Urban Cities
     * Had by far the most rides and drivers had by far the most rides and drivers
     * Had the lowest average fare for both rides and drivers despite the highest total fare dollars
2. Suburban Cities
     * These cities were in the middle for all metrics
4. Rural Cities
     * These cities had the lowest number of rides an drivers
     * They had the highest average fare despite having the lowest total fare dollars

## *Trend Analysis by City Type*
#### Our trend analysis shows the total fares by week. These data points are split by city type and are grouped by month for easier viewing. We learned several things from this graph:

1. The urban cities have significantly higher total fares than other city types
2. All cities peaked around the 3rd week of February
3. Urban cities had more variety by week overall

## *Conclusion*
We found several key insights by looking at this data and summarizing it how we did. Below are 3 recommendations to help reduce the disparities between the cities:

1. Increase the driver count in rural and suburban areas
2. Raise the cost of rides in the urban areas
3. Decrease drivers in urban areas
